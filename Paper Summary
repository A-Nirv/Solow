Mankiw, N. Gregory, David Romer, and David N. Weil. (1992):
1. In this model, output is produced from physical capital, human capital, and labor, and is used for investment in physical capital, 
investment in human capital, and 
consumption. One production function that is consistent with our empirical results is Y=K^1/3 H^1/3 L^1/3
2. There are not substantial externalities to the accumulation of physical capital, but despite the absence of externalities, 
the accumulation of
physical capital has a larger impact on income per capita than the textbook Solow model implies. A higher saving rate leads to 
higher income in steady state, which in turn leads to a higher level of human capital,even if the rate of human-capital 
accumulation is unchanged. Higher saving thus raises total factor productivity as it is usually measured.
3. population growth also has a larger impact on income per capita than the textbook model indicates.
4. In textbook Solow model implies that the economy reaches halfway to steady state in about 17 years, whereas our augmented Solow
 model implies that the economy reaches halfway in 
about 35 years.
5. We expect that differences in tax policies, education policies, tastes for children, end political 
stability will end up among the ultimate determinants of cross-country differences
