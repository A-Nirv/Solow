# Young, Alwyn. "The Tyranny of Numbers: Confronting the Statistical Realities of the East Asian Growth Experience." The Quarterly Journal of Economics 110, no. 3 (1995): 641â€“80
1.	We expect that differences in tax policies, education policies, tastes for children, end political stability will end up among the ultimate determinants of cross-country differences.
2.	All of the influences noted above-rising participation rates, intersectoral transfers of labour, improving levels of education, and expanding investment rates-serve to chip away at the productivity performance of the East Asian NICs
3.	Underlying the pervasive influence of the East Asian NICs on both theoretical and policy-oriented research in the economics profession lies a common premise: that productivity growth in these economies, particularly in their manufacturing sectors, has been extraordinarily high.
4.	The results of this paper should be heartening to economists and policymakers alike. If the remarkable post-war rise in East Asian living standards is primarily the result of one-shot increases in output brought about by the rise in participation rates, investment to GDP ratios, and educational standards and the intersectoral transfer of labour from agriculture to other sectors (e.g., manufacturing) with higher value added per worker, then eco- nomic theory is admirably well equipped to explain the East Asian experience. Neoclassical growth theory, with its emphasis on level changes in income and its well-articulated quantitative framework, can explain most of the difference between the performance of the NICs and that of other post-war economies.
