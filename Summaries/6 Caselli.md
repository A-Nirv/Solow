# Caselli, F. G. Esquivel, and F. Lefort, "Reopening the Convergence Debate: A New Look at Cross-Country Growth Empirics", Journal of Economic Growth, September 1996

The authors use a different method of estimation in cross-country empirical growth analysis where they find that the rate at which per capita incomes converge between these different countries (rich and poor) will be around 10% with their approximation methods.

Furthermore, the authors perform tests on the Solow model and benchmark them to their own model. In some cases, their results are consistent with the Solow model (of various types), but their overall conclusion is that the Solow model does not correspond well enough to their findings so they reject the versions of the model that are most widely known.
