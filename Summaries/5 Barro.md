# Barro, R. and X. Sala-i-Martin, "Convergence", Journal of Political Economy, April 1992.
Barro and Sala-i-Martin find convergence between 48 contiguous states in the united states, where poorer states grow faster than richer states. They use the standard Solow model where growth is a neoclassical production function of per worker growth. In particular they use the cobb douglass fuc=nction where f(k)=Ak^alpha. For labour augmenting technological progress they use an exponential function where effective labour = L*exp(x*t) where x is the exogenous growth of labour augmenting technological progress. The empirical results they find suggest however some unconventional values for the parameters. In particular, they find that diminishing returns to capital set in very slowly which therefore implies a higher capital shaare of the economy and hence a relatively high alpha, with a rough value of around 0.8.
