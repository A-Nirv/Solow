Output per worker differentials are explained as following:
Difference in physical capital and educational attainment are important, but not the whole picture. 
Social infrastructure = institutions and governments that determine the environment within which individuals accumulate skills and firms accumulate capital. It is an important endogenous factor, influenced by location and language.
Government acts as a protector from diversion (thievery, Mafia),but could also be the primary agent in other cases (expropriation,  corruption) 
Main channel of the effect : Social Infrastructure -> (Inputs, Productivity) -> Output per worker
